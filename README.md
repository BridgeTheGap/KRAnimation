## Intro
**KRAnimationKit** is a powerful animation kit that will allow you to implement complex animations very easily.

Inspired by [JHChainableAnimations](https://github.com/jhurray/JHChainableAnimations), KRAnimationKit provides a more structured and yet more powerful experience with animations.

Not only chaining animations, but chaining simultaneous animations, and even chaining simultaneous for multiple views has become easy with KRAnimationKit.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
